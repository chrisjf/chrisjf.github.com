<h1>La Job Privacy</h1>

<p>Please find below La Job’s <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. But first, a word on privacy:</p>

<h2>Privacy Real Talk</h2>

<p>La Job collects the minimum amount of data as possible.</p>

<p>We made the app based on the principle of data minimization, just like Apple, the European Union, and many others.</p>

<p>We know there is a balance between running a service, and overzealously collecting information, which is why we’ve written the following list and are sticking to it.</p>

<ul>

<li>Our intention is to embed privacy by design and by default in the app.</li>

<li>There is no code or tracking from Facebook in the app.</li>

<li>There is no code or tracking from Google in the app.</li>

<li>Personally identifiable information is not required to use the app.</li>

<li>If you choose to enter any personally identifiable information, we make our best effort to store it securely.</li>

<li>We do not sell your data (or any data for that matter) and have no intention to.</li>

</ul>

<h3>List of Data Collected</h3>

<p>As well, we want to provide our users with a simple and transparent list of all data collected in the app, to show that we don’t just pay lip service in our belief in privacy.</p>

<p>We truly are committed and serious about privacy.</p>

<p>We looked through all the code in the app and complied a whole table of data that is collected. (Yes, really.) We are users of software too, and we know that technology doesn’t have to act as a surveillance machine in order to be successful.</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>La Job and the developer C. Forbes (“La Job”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) provides the services rendered to you through the La Job website available at https://www.christophe.ca/lajob and through any of its web pages and associated applications which may be available on multiple devices, including mobile applications (“service”, “software”, or “app”).</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection and use practices for personal data we process in the course of providing the service.</p>


<h2>Legitimate Interest and Why Information is Processed</h2>

<p>We have a legitimate interest in being able to provide a functioning, reliable, and accessible service or website and resolve your server-request in an appropriate manner.</p>

<p>Legitimate interests include:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing the service for you and other users</li>
<li>process your subscription payments to use the service</li>
<li>preventing risk and fraud</li>
<li>answering questions or providing other types of support</li>
<li>providing and improving our products and services</li>
<li>providing reporting and analytics</li>
<li>testing out features or additional services</li>
<li>assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications</li>
</ul>

<p>We process personal information for a legitimate interest only after considering the potential risks to your privacy — for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.</p>


<h2>How Information is Processed</h2>

<p>We use your information for the purposes described below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing and securing our services</li>
<li>Communicating with you</li>
<li>Improving our websites and applications</li>
</ul>

<p>We work diligently to store your information securely and maintain the integrity of our service. We implement numerous security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. We all know that no method of transmission over the Internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.</p>


<h2>Who Has Information Access</h2>

<p>We do not rent or sell your information. We restrict access to your information to authorized employees and we do not share your information with third parties except in the circumstances explained below.</p>


<h3>Employees and Authorized Contractors</h3>

<p>Our employees and authorized contractors may need to access information about you when they require this to perform their job. For example, a customer support representative would need access to your account to validate your identity and respond to your question or request; our email communications team would need access to your contact information to ensure this information is sent correctly and any unsubscribe requests are properly managed; and our security staff would need to review information to investigate attempted denial of service attacks, fraudulent account activity, or other attempts to compromise the services. </p>


<h3>Service Providers, Partners, and Third-Party Services</h3>

<p>We use third-party service providers, such as managed hosting providers and technology partners to provide the software, networking, infrastructure and other services required to operate the services. These third-party providers may process or store personal data on servers.</p>

<p>The following is a list of service providers and their privacy polices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple (app hosting and store) <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">https://www.apple.com/privacy/</a></li>
<li>Airtable (hosting provider) <a href="https://airtable.com/privacy">https://airtable.com/privacy</a></li>
<li>Cloudflare (content delivery services and domain name server services) <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/privacypolicy/">https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/privacypolicy/</a></li>
<li>GitHub (hosting provider) <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement">https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement</a></li>
<li>Google (email provider) <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
<li>RevenueCat (subscription management) <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Successor Entities</h3>

<p>If we are acquired by or merge with another entity (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this privacy policy), if we are involved in a bankruptcy, or if the ownership or control of all or part of our services or their assets changes, information about you will be transferred to such entities.</p>


<h3>Law Enforcement, Government Agencies, and Professional Advisors</h3>

<p>We may also disclose personal data in response to legal process or when the law requires it (for example, in response to a court order) or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to protect the rights, property, or safety of our app, the service, users of the service (including you), and others.</p>


<h2>Non-personal and Personal Information</h2>

<p>The following personal information may be collected:</p>

<ul>
<li>Email address (optional)</li>
</ul>

<li>Error logs and supported data</li>
<li>Crash reports and statistics</li>
<li>Website cookie and log data (may include IP address, system configuration information, etc.)</li>
<li>Subscription Information</li>
</ul>

<p>We do our best to ensure that logs, errors, crash reports, statistics, and supported data do not contain personally identifiable information, however, we cannot guarantee this data will not contain personally identifiable information. For example, if the application crashes when processing an email address, the email address may automatically be contained in the error message and written to the log. If we find personally identifiable information in a log, we will only use this information for the purposes of debugging and service improvement, and after the bug has been resolved, we will promptly delete the personally identifiable information in the received log.</p>


<h2>Information for Non-Canadian Users</h2>

<p>This service is intended for Canadian users. By using our services and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of your country of residence.</p>

<p>The personal data that we collect from you and that you provide to us is transferred to Canada. Canada is one of the few countries for which the European Commission (EC) has adopted an adequacy decision in which it decided that Canada ensures an adequate level of protection according to European Union (EU) standards. You can review the commission’s decision here: <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32002D0002">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32002D0002</a></p>

<h2>Withdrawing Consent and Rights</h2>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may make changes to this privacy policy at any time to reflect updates to our services, applicable laws, and other factors. We will notify you of all updates by posting the changes here on this Privacy Policy webpage you are currently reading, or by any other reasonable means.
